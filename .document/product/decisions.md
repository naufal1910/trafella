### DECISION-001: Initial Tech Stack Selection

- **Date**: 2025-08-04
- **Status**: Decided

**Decision**:
Adopt a tech stack comprising FastAPI (Python) for the backend, Vue.js for the frontend, PostgreSQL with pgvector for the database, and a Vercel/Fly.io hosting combination.

**Rationale**:
- **FastAPI & Python**: Best-in-class ecosystem for AI/ML integrations, which is core to the product. Asynchronous capabilities are well-suited for a responsive, API-driven application.
- **Vue.js**: Leverages existing team expertise for faster development velocity. The component-based architecture is ideal for the planned interactive UI.
- **Postgres + pgvector**: Provides a single, robust data store for both relational data (users, trips) and vector embeddings, simplifying the architecture and reducing operational overhead.
- **Vercel / Fly.io**: Offers a modern, scalable, and cost-effective deployment strategy that separates frontend and backend concerns, with excellent developer experience.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Monolithic Framework (e.g., Django, Rails)**: Rejected to maintain a clean separation between the API and the frontend, allowing them to be developed and scaled independently.
- **Separate Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate)**: Rejected for the initial phase to minimize complexity and cost. `pgvector` is sufficient for MVP and early scaling needs.

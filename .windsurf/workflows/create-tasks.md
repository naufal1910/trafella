      For the spec at `.document/specs/{{spec_folder}}/`, generate `tasks.md` with:

      - Numbered major tasks
      - Subtasks with decimal format (e.g., 1.1, 1.2)
      - Each major task starts with a test-related subtask if one exists
      - Each major task ends with a test verification step
      - Format tasks as checklists:
        - [ ] 1. Major Task
          - [ ] 1.1 Write tests...
          - [ ] 1.2 Implement...
          - [ ] 1.3 Verify all tests pass

  - id: confirm_summary
    title: "📌 Review Task Plan"
    type: summary
    content: |
      You’ve created `tasks.md` with {{define_major_tasks.length}} major task(s) and corresponding subtasks.

      Tasks will be executed using the `execute-task` or `execute-tasks` workflows.

      Would you like to proceed with task execution?
